A password complexity checker is a tool used to evaluate the strength of a password based on a set of predefined criteria. These criteria typically include:

- Length: The password should be at least 8-10 characters long.
- Uppercase letters: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
- Lowercase letters: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
- Numbers: The password should contain at least one number.
- Special characters: The password should contain at least one special character, such as !, @, #, $, etc.
- Uniqueness: The password should not be a commonly used password or a variation of the user's name or personal information.

The password complexity checker assigns a score to the password based on how well it meets these criteria, providing an indication of its strength. This helps users create stronger passwords and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to accounts.
